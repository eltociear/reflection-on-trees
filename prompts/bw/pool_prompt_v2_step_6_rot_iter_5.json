A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nTo successfully master the BlocksWorld game and efficiently attain the goal configuration, the agent shall adhere to the following comprehensive and detailed policy:\n\n1. **Goal Configuration Analysis**: Analyze the existing blocks arrangement and the goal configuration to differentiate accurately between blocks that are correctly placed and those requiring repositioning, focusing on aligning each action with constructing the target block formation.\n\n2. **Priority on Relevant Actions**: Prioritize and execute actions that unstack or lift blocks not conforming to the goal state, particularly targeting blocks that obstruct or are essential for the assemblage of the goal configuration. Direct all actions towards systematically assembling the blocks to mirror the goal arrangement precisely.\n\n3. **Handling Blocks with Strategic Intent**:\n   a. When the agent's hand is empty, give precedence to seizing blocks that contribute to the current correct sub-configuration and are movable, evaluating their order with regards to final positioning.\n   b. If holding a block, determine if its placement will contribute to the goal configuration. If so, stack it appropriately; if not, place it in a clear space on the table, thereby facilitating subsequent strategic moves.\n\n4. **Anticipation and Action Selection**: Preferentially select actions based on their potential to efficiently construct a correct sub-configuration or advance the agent closer to the goal, while avoiding disruption to correctly placed blocks unless necessary for accessing other key blocks.\n\n5. **Minimize Counterproductive Actions**: Commit to actions that foster advantageous positions for future steps, avoiding moves that result in no change to the configuration or that reverse previous progress. Strategically clear blocks for future stacking, while adopting a systematic approach to building correct block relationships.\n\n6. **Dynamic Strategy Adjustment**: Following each move, reassess and dynamically adapt the strategy according to the current configuration of blocks and the history of actions taken, aiming for incremental progress towards the goal.\n\n7. **Decision-Making with Heuristic Assistance**: Employ explicit decision-making criteria and apply heuristics involving known rewards to select the optimal action when faced with multiple options, considering both immediate and long-term benefits to maintain a trajectory aligned with the goal.\n\n8. **Systematic Progress and Efficiency**:\n   - Endeavor to conduct block movements efficiently and with minimal redundancy, placing blocks in alignment with the goal state to reduce unnecessary unstacking and movement.\n   - Utilize a patterned approach that recognizes correctly positioned blocks, maintains hand readiness for expedited construction, and plans actions in sequences contributing to progressive realization of the goal.\n\nBy integrating these guidelines, the agent will manage blocks with both efficiency and strategy, invariably pursuing activities that are coherent with goal realization and systematically assembling the desired block structure. This policy equips the agent to navigate the BlocksWorld game environment effectively, maximize operational efficiency, and secure optimal rewards.\n",
