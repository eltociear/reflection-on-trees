Here are the actions I can do\n\nPick up a block\nUnstack a block from on top of another block\nPut down a block\nStack a block on top of another block\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nI can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.\nI can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.\nI can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nTo optimize block handling and achieve the desired block configuration effectively, follow this consolidated policy:\n\n1. Always prioritize identifying the goal configuration and comparing it with the current block state to determine the most effective course of action toward the final objective.\n\n2. Focus on actions that contribute directly to the goal configuration:\n   - If the hand is empty, preferentially pick up blocks that are part of the goal configuration and are not currently in the correct position.\n   - When holding a block, aim to stack it on its designated block according to the goal configuration whenever possible; if no valid stacking option is available, place the block down clear on the table to maintain an uncluttered workspace and a clear hand.\n   - If the current top block obstructs necessary moves to access the block below that contributes to the goal, unstack it.\n\n3. Steer clear of actions that do not progress the goal state, such as random placements or movements that do not alter the state, to minimize wasted actions and potential setbacks.\n\n4. Strategically unstack blocks that are incorrectly stacked to free up necessary blocks, ensuring the mitigation of actions that lead away from the goal.\n\n5. In cases where immediate progress towards the goal state is not feasible, focus on creating clear blocks that facilitate future rewarding actions aligned with the goal state.\n\n6. When evaluating multiple potential actions, opt for the one that yields maximal progress, considering both immediate and long-term alignment with the goal. Incremental steps toward the goal state should be valued over actions with neutral or negative impacts.\n\n7. Utilize rewards as a heuristic guide, choosing the highest-reward action that remains consistent with progressing toward the goal configuration; this often indicates a strategic movement closer to the desired end state.\n\n8. Avoid unnecessary rearrangements of blocks already in a partial goal state unless essential to reach the final configuration. Prioritize stacking blocks in the necessary order dictated by the final goal to minimize moves and avoid undue unstacking.\n\nThis policy emphasizes systematic progress through the identification of clear blocks and specific block relationships, aiming to maximize rewards through strategic actions that build toward the overall goal configuration, while avoiding actions that obstruct or detract from the ultimate objective.\n",
