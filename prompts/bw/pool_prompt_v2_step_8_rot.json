The agent\u2019s primary objective is to build the correct configuration of blocks as defined by the goal state. To achieve this, it must systematically evaluate and identify the necessary steps to arrange the blocks in the desired order.\n\n2. The agent should focus on unstacking or picking up blocks that are essential for constructing the goal configuration, especially if they are not already positioned correctly. It should endeavor to clear blocks that are part of the goal configuration by ensuring that no other blocks are stacked on top of them and are thus free to be manipulated.\n\n3. When the agent's hand is empty, it should prioritize picking up blocks that will contribute to the immediate construction of a correct sub-configuration which leads towards the overall goal configuration. Preferentially, blocks should be picked up in an order that reflects their final position in the goal state to minimize additional moves.\n\n4. If the agent is holding a block, it must assess whether placing it immediately contributes to the goal configuration. If the action is valid and moves closer to achieving the goal, it should place the block accordingly. Otherwise, the agent should put it down on the table in a clear space to keep options open for subsequent actions.\n\n5. The agent must avoid actions that do not contribute to or directly oppose the progress towards the goal configuration. This includes actions such as stacking blocks incorrectly, unstacking blocks without subsequent beneficial moves, or leaving a block in a position that further complicates the goal achievement.\n\n6. In cases where no obvious rewarding action is available, the agent should seek to create pathways for future rewarding actions. This may involve rearranging blocks to clear the way for correctly stacking them later on. The agent should ensure that blocks that will not be moved again are in their correct positions to avoid unnecessary future rearrangements.\n\n7. The agent is cautioned against repeating actions that result in no change in state or that backtrack on progress towards the goal. Consistent reevaluation is necessary to ensure that each action taken is a step forward in the puzzle-solving process, keeping in mind the final goal configuration.\n\n8. When presented with multiple actions, the agent should utilize a heuristic such as the expected reward to determine the best course of action. However, the immediate reward of an action is not the sole decision factor; the agent must focus on the sequence of actions that cumulatively progress towards the goal.\n\n9. The agent should dynamically adjust its strategy based on the current state of the blocks, the actions performed previously, and the end goal to avoid counterproductive actions.\n\nBy adhering to this policy, the agent will systematically and effectively move toward achieving the goal configuration, maximizing rewards, and reducing extraneous movements. The agent must remain attentive to the current configuration and always opt for strategic actions that align with the progression toward the desired end state.\n",
