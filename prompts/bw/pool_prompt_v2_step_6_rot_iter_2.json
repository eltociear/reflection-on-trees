A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.\nI can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.\nOnce I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.\nI can only put down a block that I am holding.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.\nI can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.\nOnce I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.\nTo optimize the arrangement of blocks and achieve the designated goal configuration within the BlocksWorld game environment, the integrated policy is established as follows:\n\n1. Analyze the current block setup critically to distinguish which blocks are properly aligned according to the final configuration. Preserve the placement of these blocks and strategize the repositioning of those that are not suitably aligned.\n\n2. Dedicate efforts to actions that have a direct impact on the realization of the goal, emphasizing:\n   - Deconstructing stacks of erroneously arranged blocks to render necessary ones accessible.\n   - Seizing blocks destined to be on top when the proper recipient block is unobstructed and the agent's hand is vacant.\n   - Strategically placing a block held by the agent atop an appropriate unblocked recipient if it advances the goal state.\n   - Depositing the block in hand to an unoccupied zone on the table when it does not immediately further the objective or obstructs access to vital blocks, thus preserving a pathway toward completing the configuration.\n\n3. When in possession of a block, aim to position it in accordance with the goal structure, by either stacking it correctly or setting it aside for future utility.\n\n4. In the absence of plain rewarding stacking prospects, pivot attention to readying crucial blocks for future actions. This involves dismantling or rearranging blocks that hinder the desired configuration or laying down the held block tactically to facilitate upcoming moves.\n\n5. Give precedence to securing blocks part of the conclusive goal shape, particularly those that form the base for accurate partial setups.\n\n6. Circumvent unproductive and regressive maneuvers that deviate from or negate progress toward the goal, such as adverse block relocation or redundant handling of the same block without contributing to the goal advancement.\n\n7. When faced with a choice of possible moves, opt for the one that promises the highest potential reward and coincides with the intended configuration, employing the reward as a gauge for the action's relative efficacy.\n\n8. Continuously refine strategy informed by the current layout, previous maneuvers, and the sequence of actions yet to be completed to ensure a consistent progression towards the goal, without dismantling correct arrangements already in place.\n\n9. Manage the hand's state effectively to prepare for the forthcoming necessary action, whether it implies being empty to grab the next block or already holding the subsequent one to be stacked.\n\n10. Order the stacking operations according to the sequence demanded by the final goal to cut down on the total number of required moves, thereby enhancing the efficiency of attaining the goal state.\n\nIn sum, this harmonized policy dictates an algorithmic blueprint for the agent to adeptly navigate its tasks while continuously considering the end goal, deliberately choosing actions that constructively build towards the desired configuration, and sidestepping needless or obstructive actions. The crux of the strategy revolves around incremental advancement, ensuring that each chosen action incrementally guides the agent to the completion of the goal configuration.\n",
