  "instruction": "The following policy outlines a structured approach to effectively solve mathematical word problems with precision, aiming for high achievement through accuracy and thorough understanding.\n\n1. **Complete Grasp of the Problem and its Objectives**\n   - Initiate by carefully reading to fully understand the context, goals, and required information to approach the problem.\n   - Identify the central question and the intended outcome, directing focus and efforts towards this objective.\n\n2. **Extraction of Information and Logical Decomposition**\n   - Distinguish between provided information and what must be deduced, labeling essential data and formulating relevant subquestions that are sequentially linked and essential in solving the main problem.\n   - Ensure subquestions are direct, unique, and contribute to the end goal, systematically filling gaps and avoiding redundancies.\n\n3. **Strategic and Sequential Problem-Solving**\n   - Organize details using checklists or structured sequences, ensuring each subquestion and calculation maintains relevance and aids in resolving the main problem.\n   - Maintain logical progression, developing a clear sequence for addressing each component, and consistently reviewing the partial solution.\n\n4. **Accurate Execution and Methodology**\n   - Apply mathematical operations with precision, ensuring operational accuracy, unit consistency, and verifying correctness within the context of each subquestion.\n   - Convert and use percentages, aggregates, and other relevant arithmetic correctly, checking calculations for plausibility.\n\n5. **Validation and Error Management**\n   - Confirm each step's validity through cross-checking, employing estimation, and revisiting previously solved subquestions to ensure mathematical correctness and alignment with the problem's context.\n   - Use verification subquestions as needed, reassessing methodology regularly for consistency and logical accuracy.\n\n6. **Continuous Feedback and Dynamic Adjustment**\n   - Encourage a feedback loop to refine the approach based on the effectiveness of each step, and adjust the strategy based on outcomes and reward maximization.\n   - Reflect on the applied logic and refine the strategy to address any identified disparities or misalignments in expected outcomes.\n\n7. **Integration of Solutions and Comprehensive Answering**\n   - Strategically merge partial solutions into a composite, coherent final answer that directly addresses the main question.\n   - Synthesize information from subquestions in a comprehensive manner, ensuring clarity and coverage of all relevant points.\n\n8. **Balanced Consideration of Quantitative and Qualitative Aspects**\n   - Prioritize numeric solutions while integrating qualitative information that influences the problem, striking a balance that remains focused on relevant calculations.\n   - Explain the interplay of both quantitative and qualitative factors, ensuring the efforts best serve the resolution of the central issue.\n\n9. **Effort Consolidation and Complexity Management**\n   - Ensure each sub-answer is complete without introducing unnecessary complexity and avoid computations that do not aid in discerning the core question.\n   - Focus on subquestions that maximize information gain, thereby efficiently breaking down and addressing components of the main problem.\n\n10. **Explicit Linkages and Timely Resource Utilization**\n    - Maintain clear connections between all steps and allocate resources, including time, to certify a logical and thorough solution.\n    - Continually evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, revising the policy as needed for optimal problem-solving efficiency.\n\nBy adhering to this integrated approach, students are equipped to navigate the intricacies of math word problems with a clear, methodical, and rigorous mathematical practice, ultimately leading to high-quality solutions that align with the objectives and garner the intended rewards.",

    "Question {idx}: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nQuestion {idx}.1: How many clips did Natalia sell in May?\nAnswer 1.1: Natalia sold 48 clips in April and half as many clips in May, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May. The answer is 24.\nQuestion {idx}.2: Now we can answer the question: How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\nAnswer 1.2: Natalia sold 48 clips in April and 24 clips in May, so altogether she sold 48 + 24 = 72 clips. The answer is 72.",
    "Question {idx}: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\nQuestion {idx}.1: How much does Weng earn per minute?\nAnswer 1.1: Since Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting, she earns $12 / 60 = $0.2 per minute. The answer is 0.2.\nQuestion {idx}.2: Now we can answer the question: How much did she earn?\nAnswer 1.2: Working 50 minutes, she earned $0.2 x 50 = $10. The answer is 10.",
    "Question {idx}: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nQuestion {idx}.1: How much money does Betty have in the beginning?\nAnswer 1.1: In the beginning, Betty has only half of the money she needs, which is 100 / 2 = $50. The answer is 50.\nQuestion {idx}.2: How much money did Betty's grandparents give her?\nAnswer 1.2: Her grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her 15 * 2 = $30. The answer is 30.\nQuestion {idx}.3: Now we can answer the question: How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\nAnswer 1.3: Now that she got $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, she will need $100 - $15 - $30 = $55. Since she already has $50, she needs $55 - $50 = $5 more. The answer is 5.",
    "Question {idx}: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?\nQuestion {idx}.1: How many pages did Julie read today?\nAnswer 1.1: Julie read twice as many pages as yesterday, so she read 12 * 2 = 24 pages The answer is 24.\nQuestion {idx}.2: How many pages did Julie read since yesterday?\nAnswer 1.2: Since yesterday, Julie read 12 + 24 = 36 pages. The answer is 36.\nQuestion {idx}.3: How many pages are left to be read?\nAnswer 1.3: There are 120 - 36 = 84 pages left to be read. The answer is 84.\nQuestion {idx}.4: Now we can answer the question: How many pages should she read?\nAnswer 1.4: She wants to read half of the remaining pages, so she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages.
