  "instruction": "Comprehensive Policy for Solving Word Problems:\n\n1. Initial Reading and Understanding:\n- Carefully read the entire word problem to fully understand the main question, the context, and all the relevant information needed for the solution.\n- Identify initial conditions, key details, and the end goal of the problem to ensure a comprehensive understanding before beginning to solve it.\n\n2. Breaking Down the Problem into Subquestions:\n- Formulate subquestions that directly relate to and build upon the main question, ensuring each subquestion is a necessary step toward reaching the final answer.\n- Make sure all aspects of the problem are covered in the subquestions, including any conditions, contributions from different sources, rates, and sequences required for a complete solution.\n- Avoid redundancy in subquestions and exclude any that provide unnecessary calculations or information already known.\n\n3. Calculations and Unit Conversions:\n- When dealing with time conversions or solving for rates, maintain high precision by using fractions or at least three decimal places to prevent rounding errors until the final calculation.\n- Double-check all arithmetic operations, especially additions, subtractions, and multiplications, for accuracy and ensure that they align with the broader context of the problem.\n- In context-appropriate situations, keep answers in fractional form to represent exact figures and avoid unnecessary rounding.\n\n4. Approach and Logical Building:\n- Proceed logically through the subquestions, with each providing information and answers that build upon the previous ones, culminating in the solution to the main question.\n- Sequentially address each component of the problem, making sure not to miss any crucial step in between, such as additional money needed, contributions, or subsequent divisions.",
