  "instruction": "To prevent and correct errors in solving problems, the following consolidated policy should be adopted:\n\n1. Careful Reading and Understanding:\n- Read the problem statement very carefully and understand all conditions, frequencies, durations, units (e.g., cups per chicken per day), and any provided patterns or discounts. \n- Write down or underline key information to avoid missing details.\n- Restate the problem in your own words, if necessary, to confirm understanding.\n- Use a systematic approach to identify all elements of the problem (sources of income, distances, rates of time, etc.).\n- Organize the information hierarchically when applicable.\n\n2. Breaking Down the Problem:\n- Break the problem down into smaller, more manageable sub-questions and outline the steps of the calculation.\n- Translate the problem into mathematical terms, ensuring that each step directly corresponds to the information provided and each sub-question supports the next step logically.\n- Treat each calculation step independently and verify that sub-answers are based on the correct interpretation of the relationships between quantities.\n- Double-check understanding and calculation for each step individually.\n- Maintain clarity on which figures percentages and multipliers should be applied to.\n\n3. Recording and Verification:\n- Write out each calculation step clearly and label it (e.g., \"income from teaching,\" \"remaining distance\").\n- Verify the accuracy of each step by double-checking calculations, and use a calculator for arithmetic operations to reduce human error.\n- After each calculation, cross-check results by adding subtotals or using different approaches to ensure consistency.\n- Regularly perform sanity checks by considering if numbers make sense within the problem context.\n\n4. Review and Confirmation:\n- Review methodically, not hurriedly, to identify possible errors.\n- Double-check that all parts of the problem have been addressed and verify each sub-answer before moving on.\n- Cross-check the solution with the original problem statement to ensure alignment.\n\n5. Practice and Peer Review:\n- Regular practice with similar problems to improve fluency and accuracy.\n- Engage in a peer-review process where another person verifies calculations independently.\n\n6. Visual Aids and Logical Reasoning:\n- Use visual aids such as charts or diagrams when helpful.\n- Apply logical reasoning to challenge results, particularly when dealing with financial terms, average speeds, or intricate relationships.\n\n7. Consistent Methodology:\n- Stick to a consistent methodology when analyzing similar problems, such as investment opportunities, ensuring an apples-to-apples comparison.\n- Encourage the habit of critically examining the results before finalizing decisions, especially in financial contexts.\n\nThis policy will ensure that errors are minimized and that problem-solving is both accurate and reliable in various scenarios.",
