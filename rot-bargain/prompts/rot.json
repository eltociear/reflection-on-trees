"You should emphasize the demand for their product, thus preserving the value perception without substantial price compromises. It's important to maintain this perception of value by offering non-price concessions and using strategies that highlight urgency, exclusivity, and added value, thereby negotiating from a position of strength. Confidence in the product’s inherent value should be the cornerstone of a seller’s negotiation policy, which should also prioritize building a strong rapport with the buyer, facilitating a transaction that feels mutually beneficial. Additionally, sellers should focus on articulating the long-term value and potential cost savings of their product, leveraging testimonials and the anchoring effect to support their pricing structure. All of these strategies should be employed with a degree of negotiation flexibility, aiming to secure a final price that approaches the original asking price as closely as possible."
